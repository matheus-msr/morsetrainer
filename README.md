Simple program that helps you to memorizr the morse alphabet including characters from A-Z and numbers from 0-9

The program consists of two options:

"ascii > morse" were the user has to type the representation in morse of the given ascii character using dots (.) and dashes (-)
"morse > ascii" were a sound is played and the user is presented with a representation of the sound using dashes and dots, in this mode the user must type the corresponding ascii character to the morse sound and representation he is given

At the result screen, that shows if the user input is correct, the 'enter' key can be used and has the same effect that the 'OK' button, and the 'escape' key can be used and has the same effect as the 'back' button.
